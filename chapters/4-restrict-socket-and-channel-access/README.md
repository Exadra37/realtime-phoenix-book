## Restrict Socket and Channel Access

> We'll use a Phoenix.Token to pass authentication information from the server 
> to the view, and then will use that to add Channel access restriction to the
> JavaScript client. You'll learn when to use a single Socket or multiple 
> Sockets in your applications, based on the restriction needs of your system.

### Why Restrict Access?

> It has been a common occurrence to hear about data leaks from improperly
> secured data or endpoints. This type of security issue can hit any application,
> including ones based on Phoenix Channels.

> There are two different types of access restriction that we'll focus on. The first
> type of restriction, authentication, prevents non-users from accessing your
> application. If someone malicious is able to discover your Socket connection
> URL and then successfully connect, they may be able to access more of your
> system. The second type of restriction, authorization, prevents users from
> accessing each other's data. If your application exposed information about a
> particular user, even non-sensitive information, you would want only that
> specific user to see it.

> When you want to prevent non-users from connecting to your application, you 
> add authentication to the Socket. When you want to restrict access to user 
> data, you add authorization to the Channel and topic.

> You'll use both types of restriction to fully secure your real-time application.

### Add Authentication to Sockets

> You can use Socket authentication when you want to restrict a client's access
> to a real-time connection.

> When you add authentication checks at the very edge of your
application, in the Socket, youâ€™re able to avoid writing code that checks if
there is a logged in user lower in the system. This improves your system's
maintainability because your user session check exists in a single location.

> You can add Socket authentication to your application by using a securely
> signed token.

### Securing a Socket with Signed Tokens

> WebSockets lack CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) restrictions that are
> used by other types of web requests. The biggest vulnerability that this
> exposes is a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack. In a CSRF attack, a
> different website controlled by the attacker initiates a request to your
> application. The attacker may be able to use this connection as if they were
> the user, receiving private data about the user or making changes to the
> user's data.
