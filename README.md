# REALTIME PHOENIX BOOK

Following along the [Real-Time Phoenix - Build Highly Scalable Systems with Channels](https://pragprog.com/titles/sbsockets/real-time-phoenix/) by Stephen Bussey.

If you want to buy this book, then you may want to grab a 35% discount code from the [Elixir Forum Giveaways](https://elixirforum.com/t/elixir-forum-update-2022-the-100-000-issue/45299) page.

Will copy/paste here what I consider some of the highlights of the book, that will be shown as quotes.

I may also take some notes of my own, but probably not many.
